## TOS Violations
If we suspect that you have violated our Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policies, we may not provide a refund. Additionally, we do not offer refunds for virtual machines suspected of being used for cryptocurrency projects, such as Quilibrium, or for cryptocurrency mining operations.

## Refunds
Within **14 days** (2 weeks) of placing an order, if you are unhappy with the products or services that you receive, we may be able to grant you a refund as long as you paid with a qualifying payment method and have a qualifying service that is eligible for a refund (e.g., cryptocurrency payments or dedicated servers are non-refundable).

In order to request a refund as per our refund policies, you must open a ticket within the **14-day** (2-week) time limit to our sales department. A cancellation request is not sufficient for requesting a refund, a ticket must be opened. Once the request is in the system, a refund will be initiated within 7 business days. After a refund is initiated, please note that it can take a few days for your bank to process the refund.

Any payment fees associated with the transaction may be deducted from the refund, such as fees charged by our payment processors. We reserve the right to deny you a refund depending on the circumstances (e.g., if we detect suspicious or fraudulent activity).

Account credit deposits are **NOT** eligible for refunds under any circumstances.

Please note that a maximum of **5** servers can be refunded per account. Past that, any refunds that are processed will have a **50%** processing fee deducted. We reserve the right to update this policy at any time, with or without notification.

## Changes to the Policy
We may amend this policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to check for changes in our privacy policy and make sure that you are up to date. We may send an email notice when major changes occur.
