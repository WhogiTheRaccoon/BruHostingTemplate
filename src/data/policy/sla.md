## Qualifying Events
SLA credits are generally issued when you open a ticket requesting for SLA to be claimable. A ticket must be opened within **72 hours** of a qualifying event in order to be eligible for SLA compensation.

These qualifying events may include, but are not limited to:
- Network Outages
- Power Outages
- Datacenter Failures
- Host Node Issues

We do not provide SLA for the following events:
- Network Packet Loss
- Network Throughput Issues
- Failures Caused by the Client
- Failures on Individual VPS's
- Performance Issues
- Scheduled Maintenance Period
- VPS Cancellation/Suspension

## Our Guarantee
We guarantee a 99% uptime SLA across all of our services. Here is a chart of the credits we will provide:

| Downtime Period    | Service Credit           |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 Hour of Downtime | Service Extended by 1 Day|
| 2 Hours of Downtime| Service Extended by 2 Days|
| 3 Hours of Downtime| Service Extended by 3 Days|
| 4 Hours of Downtime| Service Extended by 4 Days|
| 5 Hours of Downtime| Service Extended by 5 Days|
| 6 Hours of Downtime| Service Extended by 6 Days|
| 7+ Hours of Downtime| Service Extended by 2 Weeks|

There must be a minimum of **1 hour** of downtime in order for SLA credit to be issued.

## Claiming SLA Credits
Please note that in order to claim the SLA credits, you must meet the following requirements:
- Your account must be in good standing.
- You must not have created a chargeback.
- You must have created a ticket within 72 hours of the qualifying event.
- Your service must not be cancelled/suspended.
- SLA can only be claimed once per incident.

**Note:** Multiple outages in a row can be considered part of the same incident, as long as the root cause is the same. For example, if your host node were to go offline due to an issue with an SSD (as an example), momentarily comes back online, and then goes back offline due to the same problem, that would be considered as one incident/event and can only have SLA claimable once. In order to identify whether your outage is related to the same incident/problem, please refer to our status page at [https://status.whogiworld.com](https://status.whogiworld.com). If the incidents are NOT considered separately with different incident IDâ€™s, then SLA would not be claimable twice. We reserve the right to deny SLA compensation depending on the circumstances.

## Changes to the Policy
We may amend this policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to check for changes in our privacy policy and make sure that you are up to date. We may send an email notice when major changes occur.
