## Cookies
We employ the use of cookies. By accessing WhogiWorld, you agreed to use cookies in agreement with WhogiWorld's Privacy Policy.

Most interactive websites use cookies to let us retrieve the user's details for each visit. Cookies are used by our website to enable the functionality of certain areas.


## Hyperlinking to our Content
Anyone may hyperlink or link to our website.


## iFrames
Without prior approval and written permission, you may not create iframes of our website.


## Your Privacy
Please read our Privacy Policy.


## Removal of Links from Our Website
If you find any link on our Website that is offensive for any reason, you are free to contact and inform us at any moment. We will consider requests to remove links but we are not obligated to do so or to respond to you directly.


## Billing
Invoices for your services are typically generated 1 week, or more, in advance. If there is a failure to pay the invoice, we typically suspend your service after 3 days of the due date (once repeated emails are sent), and your service may be terminated after 1 week. We may keep your service for longer depending on the product.

- If the product page states that the service is in the "Suspended" state, there is a high chance that the data is still there.
- If it shows that your service is in the "Terminated" state, then your data and/or service is most likely not available anymore.
- It is your duty to submit a cancellation request through the control panel before the service due date. Failure to do so may result in the payment method on file being charged and/or the invoice not being properly cancelled.
- Our refund policy is outlined in the Refund Policy.


## Multiple Accounts
Multiple accounts are allowed as long as it is not for the purposes of:

- Utilizing a one-per-account promotion code again
- Fraudulent activity
- Evading account closure or bans

If you are caught violating this policy, we reserve the right to close the duplicate accounts without a refund.

The information on your accounts must be consistent across all of them (i.e., full name, address, phone number). If this is not the case, we will reach out and request that you update it.


## Geolocation
Please note that the geolocation of our subnets may not be correct as geolocation services are maintained by third-party databases and organizations. If you are using our servers to access region-locked content, please contact us beforehand so that we can confirm.


## Storage
To provide you with our services, we will have to store your service’s files on our servers.

- Sometimes, backups of your servers may be stored depending on the product you purchased.
- We sometimes keep backups of your service in an off-site location depending on the product.
- You may request to have your files deleted at any time.


## Fair Use
Please read our Fair Use policy for more information.


## Email Sending
We block port 25 by default and email sending across our infrastructure. We recommend using a third-party service like Amazon SES if you are planning to send mail. The only exception is on web hosting plans, where we use third-party solutions to send out mail and carefully monitor to ensure that no spam is sent out.

If we believe that you are intentionally sending email spam, we reserve the right to charge a $25 USD IP cleaning fee.


## Service Transfers
There is a $5 USD transfer fee if you wish to transfer your service to another client account. This covers the administrative work of transferring services.


## Abuse
If we receive an abuse complaint, you are required to respond within 24 hours or your service will be suspended (or terminated after 7 days). If we see repeat abuse or intentional acts of abuse that may harm our infrastructure, we may take action immediately.

Some types of activity we prohibit include:

- Port Scanning
- Brute Forcing
- Sending DDoS or DoS attacks
- IP Spoofing
- Phishing Attacks
- Email Spamming
- Copyrighted Content
- Using "Cracked" Software

TOR exit nodes are allowed in certain locations; please contact us first before running one as we need to verify a couple of parameters and make sure that you are in the correct locations and/or on the correct IPv4 ranges.

Our fair use conditions for resources in our services are outlined in our Fair Use policy.

We base illegal activity on United States law and the law that your server is based in. If your service is based in Germany, you are required to follow both German law and United States law on your service. It is your duty to perform due diligence and make sure that what you are doing on your services is perfectly legal.

Copyrighted content is strictly forbidden on our services, and we will take action if we receive repeated copyright complaints. We do not ignore DMCA requests; most DMCA requests double as copyright infringement notifications.


## Termination
We reserve the right to terminate your service with or without a reason and with or without notice at any time.


## Data Loss
We are not responsible for any data loss across our services. Sometimes we take backups, but it is not a guarantee and it's the customer’s responsibility to take their own backups.


## Tebex
We partner with Tebex Limited ([www.tebex.io](https://www.tebex.io)), who are the official merchant of digital content produced by us. If you wish to purchase licenses to use digital content we produce, you can do so through Tebex as our licensed reseller and merchant of record.

For any queries about a purchase made through Tebex, including but not limited to refund requests, technical issues, or billing inquiries, contact Tebex support at [Tebex Support](https://www.tebex.io/contact/checkout).


## Changes to the Policy
We may amend this policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to check for changes in our privacy policy and make sure that you are up to date. We may send an email notice when major changes occur.
